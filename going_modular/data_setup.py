    """Creates training and testing DataLoaders.

    Takes in a training directory and testing directory path and turns
    them into PyTorch Datasets and then into PyTorch DataLoaders.

    Args:
        train_dir : Path to training directory.
        test_dir: Path to testing directory.
        train_transform: torchvision transforms to perform on training data.
        test_transform: torchvision transforms to perform on testing data.
        batch_size: Number of samples per batch in each of the DataLoaders.
        num_workers: An integer for the number of workers per DataLoader.

    Returns:
        A tuple of (train_dataloader, test_dataloader, class_names).
        Where class_names is a list of the target classes.
        Example Usage:
        train_dataloader, test_dataloader, class_names = create_dataloaders(train_dir = path/to/train_sir,
            test_dir = path/to/test_dir,
